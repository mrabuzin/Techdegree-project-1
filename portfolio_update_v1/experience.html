        <h2> Job experience </h2>
        <p>When I was a student I worked in Transcom(Osijek, Croatia) as a Customer Support Representative. That was
          not a programming job but I learned a lot there. Most importantly I learned how to work in team with other people
        where everyone have their own duties to do. </p>
